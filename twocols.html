HELLO THERE
<div>
	<p id="p1">A confident woman is someone who knows who they are and what they want. They know that life isn't perfect, but they're not afraid to get out there and take charge of their own destiny. Confident people aren't defined by their past or present - instead, they focus on the future, which always holds endless possibilities for them.
	</p>
	<p id="p2">1. Confident women are optimistic. 
They're always looking on the bright side of life and find something to celebrate every day, no matter what they go through.

Confidence isn't about being pessimistic or cynical; it's about seeing all possibilities in your future because you know that anything is possible if you work for it.

It's knowing that even if you fail, you're going to get back up and try again because the only way for anything in life to work out is if we give it our all.</p>
